/*
 * Note: üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
 * Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
   The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference 
   is used to refer to a child class object. 
 
 * Types of Java Polymorphism
   1. Compile Time Polymorphism
      Is also known as static polymorphism and it is implemented by method overloading.

   2. Run Time Polymorphism
      Is also known as dynamic method dispatch and it is implemented by the method overriding.
